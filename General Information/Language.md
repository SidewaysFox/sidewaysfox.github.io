A vast range of languages exist in the galaxy, from Common, to Hagurr, to local languages such as Nestrikian. Language is often a core part of a culture, as it is generally what is used to pass down information and stories from generation to generation.

| Celasce    | [[Cindus\|Cindii]]        | According to existing records, Celasce may have been one of the first vocal languages to have been developed in the galaxy. A language utilising many hard and hissing sounds, Celasce is used by the people of its namesake.                                                                        | School               |

| Linla      | [[Linc]]                  | Due to their usual habitats being underwater, the Linc did not develop a vocal language until quite late. As a result, Linla is mainly a combination of Dottian and Human, influenced by their two closest neighbours.                                                                               | School               |

| Meridian   | [[Myriad\|Myriads]]       | The Myriads do not bear mouths or any system with the sole purpose to produce sound. A lot of their communication occurs through body language. However, they were able to develop the buzzing sounds of their micronoids into a vocal language.                                                     | School               |

It is also one of the few languages to utilise whistling in its phonetic system.                                                                             | University           |
| Zhash      | [[Dottian\|Dottians]]     | A language similar in nature to the English of Humans, Zhash is comprised of a wide range of sounds. It tends to be of a more moderate and consistent pitch than other languages and is often mistaken to be lacking in emotion for that reason.                                                     | School               |
