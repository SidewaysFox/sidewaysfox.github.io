Interstellar travel refers to how material can travel between star systems. It is vital to any space-faring civilisation that interstellar travel can be accomplished in as short of a time as physically possible, as simply moving quickly through empty space can still take years, and often decades or even centuries.

The most commonly used method of travelling long distances in a short amount of time is through utilising wormholes. By “tearing” a small hole in the fabric of the space-time continuum, a temporary wormhole that a ship can move through can be created. This is done through the use of advanced wormhole generation machines called Wormhole Drives - gigantic and complex systems that often take up a large percentage of a starship’s volume. The drive size to wormhole size tend to be directly proportional - the larger the wormhole drive, the larger the possible size of the wormhole. From entrance time to exit time, one trip through an artificial wormhole can take from 15 minutes to upwards of six hours, proportionate to the relative stability and overall distance to the target destination.

However, wormholes are not a completely safe mode of transport, as they often present a considerable amount of danger to both the travelling party and structures nearby the exit location. As such, warning signals (in the form of a specific band of radar ping) are often transmitted to the area around the destination to notify nearby ships of the incoming opening.


### Use in communications

Long range (from planet to planet or even system to system) communication systems use a miniature form of wormhole drives, typically called Long Range Transmission Ports (LRTP) to quickly be passed over long distances. This extremely fast method of bypassing distance can reduce the relative travel time of transmissions from several decades to a few minutes.


### Time/velocity relevance

Calculations performed by researchers show that the average of ~2 hours to travel between adjacent planets in a system hints at an equivalent relative velocity of about 2% of the speed of light. However, with more power being used to travel between nearby systems, this percentage increases exponentially. It is worth noting that time is not expected to function exactly the same within active wormholes and it is still a mystery as to exactly how and why it differs. Some argue that the estimated velocities that come out of these calculations are not at all relevant to the operation of wormholes due to these seemingly arbitrary inconsistencies.
