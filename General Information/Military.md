A military is typically a group of combat-trained troops encompassing either a star fleet, an air force, a navy, an army, a defence force, or a combination of the five. Militaries are each made up of a set of ranks that define the troop hierarchy, usually extending from a small group of top leaders down to conscripts and/or recruits. They are equipped with vehicles, weaponry and gear from various manufacturers, often receiving them on a long-term contract.


### Governmental militaries

Each governmental body in the galaxy that oversees its own territory will often have a military of its own. These militaries answer to the government leaders themselves, especially if there is a war cabinet in office. The [[Kolban Alliance]], civilisation governments and larger or more wealthy systems fund their own military forces. In less wealthy systems and planets, militaries may not be financially viable, so security forces are hired instead. These forces often have to remain privately funded and as such commonly run with less modern equipment.


### Private militaries

Private militaries owned by wealthy businesses and even wealthier individuals are not uncommon. They are less organised than that of a running government but remain very powerful when commanded by an adequate leader and equipped with up-to-standard weaponry. However, they do remain monitored by the government to ensure the safety and legitimacy of the organisation.


### Illegal organisations

Although they are not officially considered militaries, stronger crime syndicates will often have powerful or dangerous groups of mercenaries on their side, usually purchased with large amounts of money on contract.
