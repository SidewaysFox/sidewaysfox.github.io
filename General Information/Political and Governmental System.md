Most of the galaxy is interconnected within a major political hierarchy, stemming from the [[Kolban Alliance]]’s Kolban Council at the very top all the way down to the individual planet regional boards. The system is designed to create a complex web of interconnection between different levels of leadership to allow for efficient development without inhibiting the governments' ability to communicate with each other and with other third parties outside.

At the bottom of the hierarchy lie the regional boards, who specifically oversee their designated section of a planet (could be as small as one tenth of the planet to as large as one quarter), such as infrastructure instalment and community management. One step above are the planetary councils, who tend to run the entire planet at a local level, from making and maintaining local laws to contracting and policing. If a system only has one planet, the planetary council usually does not operate.

Above the planetary councils are the system governments, who run and coordinate each planet in the system as a whole. The majority of system governments report directly to their civil government. The civil government runs every system in an astral territory. For example, the [[Grandusk]] civil government runs every system that lies within the Grandusk astral territory. When referring to individual civil governments, the word “civil” is often omitted, making it Grandusk government, as an example.

Assuming one is part of the Kolban Alliance, the very peak of the hierarchy is the alliance itself, which maintains general order between each of the recognised [[races]]. The alliance is ultimately overseen and led by the Kolban Council, a collection of democratically elected members from every race recognised by the [[Kolban Pact]]. The Kolban Council itself has its own small hierarchy, divided based on the agreed relative power of each civilisation. The Co-Council consists of races recognised by the pact but who do not make significant enough contributions to the order of the galaxy. The Primary Council includes the main races involved with all processes.

Every level of the political and governmental system in the galaxy contributes at least in small part to the stability of the controlled territories. Each one communicates mainly with the two above and below, but also have the ability to do so with any other level in an emergency.
