There are many currencies in the galaxy, each with their own origins and values. However, the universal currency used by members of the [[Kolban Alliance]] comes in the form of galactic tekks and galactic drons. Ten drons are equivalent in value to one tekk. In a typical trade, only tekks are used, unless the trade is for a small or specific amount, which would require the use of drons.


### Independent currencies

Some smaller civilisations (even some being a part of the Kolban Alliance and actively using galactic tekks) use their own unique currencies. The exact uses and forms of these currencies can vary.

| Currency | Civilisation | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Poid     | [[Wythin]]   | Small chips of refined aerolite. The value of each poid is determined by the chip's size. Poids are independently utilised by the Wythins and usually not accepted as payment outside of Aeroth. |


### Obsolete currencies

Many currencies have become dated and have since been replaced by either the Kolban's galactic currencies or by a newer one.

| Currency | Civilisation | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Boss     | [[Grandusk]] | Pieces of bark from the Tekio tree originating on Tryas. The Grandusk economy often suffered from these pieces being eaten by native fauna.                                                                                                     |
| Draug    | [[Dottian]]  | An obsidian-based chip used in large quantities for trades between Dottian individuals. The exact value of a Draug varied based on the person owning it (those in higher up positions such as managers had more valuable Draug and vice versa). |
| Dollar   | [[Human]]    | A currency used by the unified Human civilisation. Easily identified by its round metallic coins, the dollar also had a secondary value called the cent.                                                                                        |
| Eulon    | [[Myriad]]   | Myriads often traded in the corpses of their micronoids. They served as backup sustenance if food reserves ran low.                                                                                                                             |
| Laval    | [[Cindus]]   | Rough pieces of hardened volcanic rock originating from planets in Firezin. Laval remains in use to this day as a cultural phenomenon, but is no longer used as a currency.                                                                     |
| Maoh     | [[Linc]]     | Small metal balls made from hydrophobic polycrystalline silver were historically circulated between Linc tradespeople. These balls were called Maoh, and eventually became the Linc's standard currency.                                        |
| Vthal    | [[Xanfer]]   | Similar to the Human dollar, the Vthal is a currency based on metallic square coins.                                                                                                                                                            |
