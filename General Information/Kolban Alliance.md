The Kolban Alliance is a universal multi-racial alliance between all of the Kolban-recognised civilisations. Formed after the official signing of the [[Kolban Pact]], the alliance maintains order in the centre of the galactic territories by regulating political and/or business activity and providing security or [[military]] assistance when appropriately requested. The Kolban Alliance maintains a consistently neutral political standing in order to remain as unbiased as possible.


### Uniformities

Within the next few years after its creation, the Kolban Alliance established several universal systems, including but not limited to [[Political and Governmental System|political and governmental systems]], [[currency]], security and even a common [[language]]. Most of these changes were made to further solidify the unification of the many civilisations that had been recognised by the Kolban Pact. Although there was backlash directed at some of them from a wide variety of members of each of the social classes, almost all of the originally proposed changes were passed and put in place.


### Government

The Kolban Alliance, being led by a diverse council based on a democratic governmental system, was immediately tasked with appropriately establishing a working political system that would systematically support as many [[people]] as possible. It was ultimately settled that the Alliance would operate on a political and governmental hierarchy. This system remains in place to this day, with the diverse Kolban Council overseeing all of the territories as a whole.


### Currency

Before and during the [[Cosmian Wars]], civilisations' currency systems were unique to one another, and conversion between them was a lengthy process. Early Kolban leaders sought to unify the universalise the currencies to allow for easier inter-civil trade. Most of the preceding currencies made use of both a main value and a secondary value (such as the [[Human]] dollar and cent) and every recognised civilisation operated with the decimal numeral system. This made it convenient to carry these attributes forward into the new currency, which ultimately became galactic tekks and drons.


### Security

A significant problem faced by the newly founded Kolban Alliance was that of security. Despite being a conglomerate of several civilisations, the Alliance itself did not initially have a particularly large military force. This meant that in the first few years piracy and other crime grew partially out of control. Part of the governing body's solution to this issue was to "borrow" personnel and equipment from the militaries of the larger civilisations - namely the Human, [[Sleethier]] and [[Dottian]] militaries. Over time, as funding increased, the military strength of the Kolban Alliance increased as well and security became less of an immediate issue.


### Language

The formation of the Kolban Alliance also brought to life a new language, that due the nature of its use, was called "Common". According to official figures, it took linguists several decades to configure the basis of the language and its vocabulary. Based off of a mix of the Human language English and several other dialects from the other mainstream languages, Common is now used throughout the galaxy by every civilisation and is by far the most widely spoken tongue.
