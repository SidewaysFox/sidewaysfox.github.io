Contrary to conventional soup as a liquid food, Soup (capitalised) is a widely used naturally-occurring drug featuring properties that give it an extensive range of applications in several industries (including starship manufacturing), outside of recreational use. Being a solid grainy powder at temperatures below ~20ÂºC and a viscous liquid at temperatures above, Soup is considered a favourable resource in the industries it is used in. It often fetches considerably high prices in markets both within the [[Kolban Alliance]] and beyond. As such, it is extravagantly extracted from the crusts of planets, within asteroids and even occasionally from comets.


### Common uses

Soup, being a drug, is used medicinally due to its sweet taste coupled with its pain-relieving properties. However, it is often also used recreationally. There have been no discovered significant health effects from regularly consuming Soup (some may experience minor headaches and/or issues with their digestive tract), although it can be quite dangerous if consumed in overly excessive quantities. Despite this, it is advised to avoid ingesting Soup too often in order to avoid unhealthy diet conditions.
