Before the creation of the [[Kolban Alliance]], no solid universal system of tracking time had been introduced, with each civilisation using their own and refusing to change. Upon the signing of the [[Kolban Pact]] however, the need to do so became apparent. Universal time is now managed through the existence of the Galactic Time Constant (GTC). Individual planets may apply an offset to their local time according to daylight times.

The numerical year system is based off of how many years have passed since the first colonisation of new systems by the Dottians. This is designated as the Cosmic Era, or CE. Alternatively, events occurring before 0 CE are appropriately designated with Before Cosmic Era, or BCE. The remainder of the time units run according to the Human-invented system, with seconds serving as one of the [[Scientific Standard]]'s base units.


### Galactic Time Constant

| Unit              | Number of seconds     |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Millisecond       | 0.001                 |
| Second            | 1                     |
| Minute            | 60 (60 seconds)       |
| Hour              | 3,600 (60 minutes)    |
| Day               | 86,400 (24 hours)     |
| Week              | 604,800 (7 days)      |
| Month             | 2,592,000 (30 days)   |
| Month (alternate) | 2,678,400 (31 days)   |
| Year              | 31,536,000 (365 days) |
| Leap year         | 31,622,400 (366 days) |
It is to be noted that the month of February is not 30 or 31 days in length. However, its length of 28 days (and 29 in leap years) has never been included in the Galactic Time Constant as an official unit. This is primarily due to the lack of full consistency in its application.
