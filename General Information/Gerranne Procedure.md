The Gerranne Procedure (named after [[Human]] scientist and researcher [[Gerranne, Yun|Yun Gerranne]]) is a highly classified long-term program designed to transform planets into perfectly spherical celestial bodies, in order to stabilise their orbital and rotational movement patterns. It was originally performed by the Gerranne Rotunda Project, a large collection of researchers and experts handpicked by the Human government. Much of the technology and information involved is unknown to the public and very little explanation as to why the Gerranne Procedure was pursued outside of its simple purpose has been supplied by the Human government.


### Operation

After several months of deliberation, the planet Sling in the system of Soluoka became the original target for the procedure to take place. However, a catastrophic failure of undisclosed nature occurred just after two months into the operation and prevented the completion of the procedure. A few years afterwards, the nearby planet of Fest became the new target and the procedure ultimately resulted in a "resounding success".

Remnant scraps from the massive devices used to both power and carry out the operations have been left over on Sling and Fest. These scraps are believed to contain little to no relevant information to do with the Gerranne Procedure itself, but scavengers are still often seen picking up pieces, most likely for use of the basic materials.
