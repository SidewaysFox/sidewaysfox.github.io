The Kolban Pact is a treaty signed during the year 2523 after the events of the long-winded [[Cosmian Wars]]. It outlined many terms regarding the equality of the recognised [[races]] and the orders of society. The main item presented to the parties involved in the signing of the pact was the creation of the [[Kolban Alliance]], a coalition designed to maintain peace amongst the space-faring civilisations for as long as possible. The pact itself was named after the planet Kolban, in the Jolloy system, where the treaty was signed.

Despite some initial disagreements on several terms of the treaty, all parties eventually agreed to the terms. The first signing was performed by the [[Sleethier|Sleethier]] representatives and occurred on the 1st of December. The pact's final signing was performed by the [[Dottian]] and [[Wythin]] representatives and occurred seven days later on the 8th of December, 2523. The Kolban Pact was established and enacted on the 25th of December and remains in existence to the present day.


### Races formally recognised

The Kolban Pact formally recognised several different races and their civilisations. It also allows for additions to be made in the future, although this is still yet to happen. Once per decade, usually on the first year, the pact is passed by the leaders of each civilisation to verify the upholding of its terms. It is first held by the [[Linc]], then sent to the Dottians, the [[Grandusk|Grandusks]], the [[Myriad|Myriads]], the [[Cindus|Cindii]], the Sleethiers, the [[Xanfer]] and finally the [[Human|Humans]]. Due to their largely uninvolved nature and uncaring stance, the Wythins are not sent the pact.
