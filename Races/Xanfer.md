The Xanfer is a bipedal humanoid originating from the planet Klaw in the Amberond system. They were the fifth [[Races|race]] to begin space-faring, doing so very shortly before the [[Cindus|Cindii]]. As such, they have both a [[military]] of respectable size and stable economy. Despite this, their contribution to the [[Kolban Alliance]] is overall limited enough to warrant only a Co-Council position in the government. Recent efforts have been made to attempt to step up to the Primary Council, in the form of monetary support and military supplies.


### Physical attributes

The Xanfer feature pale red skin with thick limbs and fingers. An interestingly close relative to the [[Human|Humans]] in terms of genetic information, the Xanfer bear much of the same characteristics as their counterparts from Estra, only having evolved a higher bone density and stronger muscles due to the high gravitational pull on their home planet. There is no evidence to support that the two races are actually related, however. Researchers have dubbed this phenomenon as "either the most profound coincidence or the best-kept secret in the galaxy".

Thanks to their strong biology, Xanfer [[people]] are capable of easily surviving up to around 4 Gs of gravity. On the other hand, this prevents them from easily living in 1 G or lower conditions. This is due to their accelerated loss of muscle mass and bone density. The average Xanfer's relatively light diet means they often do not manage to maintain their body mass for very long without a consistent significant gravitational pull to resist.


### Behaviour and culture

Although they bear a resemblance to humans in their physical appearance and genetics, the Xanfer have a very different culture. Where their counterparts are known to be self-serving and distrusting, the Xanfer tend to represent the opposite. It is rare for them to work alone or for themselves, usually wishing to contribute their work and time toward a greater cause. This holds true also for their attitudes toward their environment, with many Xanfer showing general interest in the protection of [[nature]] and the local wildlife.

Much of their behaviour is in relation to their common involvement in religion. Several popular religions have arisen out of the cultural climate on Klaw. Approximately 65% of the Xanfer population are religious, but this percentage tends to decrease every decade following the trend in the other civilisations.
