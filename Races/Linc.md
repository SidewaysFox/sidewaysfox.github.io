The Linc is a quadrupedal limited-humanoid originating from the planet Inloreen in the Mala system. They were the fourth [[Races|race]] to begin space-faring and are naturally an independent race. However, due to the consequences of the [[Cosmian Wars]], the Linc hold one of the smallest total populations out of any space-faring civilisation in the galaxy, only greater than the [[Wythin|Wythins]], who rarely venture beyond their home system Aeroth. As an important member of the [[Kolban Alliance]] however, the Linc civilisation receives a considerable amount of support from the alliance, primarily coming from the [[Human|Humans]] and the [[Xanfer]], their two closest trade partners.


### Physical attributes

One of the most unique races in terms of physical anatomy, the Linc are not bipedal and are only partially humanoid. With four tentacle-like legs arranged with two on each side below their hips, two tentacles at the top of their torso and a large head positioned above, they are able to make themselves appear humanoid when clothed. A mainly aquatic race, the Linc evolved to survive underwater at depths of up to 2,000 metres on a planet similar to Inloreen or Estra. However, this does not mean they are fully incapable of surviving on land. Their adaptive bodies allow them to live out of the water with only one set of assistive gear, called Linc Assistive Survival Equipment (LASE).

Linc's bodies' limitations can cause them to have trouble working with or handling gear designed for [[people]] with fingered hands. There is available technology that can be used to work around this problem for most pieces of regularly used equipment, but it is not perfect and cannot solve every related issue.


### Behaviour and culture

The Linc are frequently described as a traditional but kind race and are especially known for their intellectual prowess. The second race (after the [[Dottian|Dottians]], who are also remarked to have had a head-start) to construct a functioning wormhole drive and achieve [[Interstellar Travel]], the Linc are regularly at the forefront of technological progress. Although not as diverse of a civilisation as others, the Linc are still fully free-thinking, with their civil government funding several multiracial youth development courses.

Most Linc are not religious, as no widespread religions ever developed before their first contact with other civilisations. Many of their people are instead of the belief that following a singular religion stifles their outward creativity. This belief has led to a lack of cultural diversity as well, in addition to their lack of physical and mental diversity. Psychologists generally agree that these issues contribute to their recent slowing of societal development.
