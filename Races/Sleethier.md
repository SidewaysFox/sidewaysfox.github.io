The Sleethier is a transmutative intelligent organism originating from the planet Veris in the Baroness system. As the second [[Races|race]] to begin space-faring, the Sleethiers are highly advanced in their technology. Despite not involving themselves in most conflicts within the galaxy, their large industry in electronics makes them a relatively significant trade partner for many of the other members in the [[Kolban Alliance]].


### Physical attributes

The Sleethiers are the only intelligent race with the full ability of active transmutation, although it is a slow process. On average, it can take up to eight hours for a complex transformation to complete. Limitations to the ability mean they can only express forms they fully understand the workings of. Although triggered mainly on command, slight transmutations often occur on instinct based on emotions.

Despite their unique gelatinous mutative "flesh", Sleethiers' bodily materials bear similar traits to the muscle fibres of other races. It is equally susceptible to damage from external sources, such as fire or acid. However, when in the process of transforming, the increased rate of oxygen and nutrient intake required by Sleethier body cells also makes them more vulnerable to chemical reactions.


### Behaviour and culture

The Sleethiers are primarily an independence-focused civilisation. Their generally anti-social tendencies mean they do not like to ask for assistance with their problems from third parties. As a result, they are also not quick to offer help to others. This behaviour has earned them a dubious position within the Kolban Alliance. Various people of other races argue that the Sleethiers' limited interest and involvement in foreign affairs takes away from their significance as a member of the Alliance, suggesting that they should be move to a lesser position in the Kolban Council. However, this has not occurred due to their "overall technological and scientific contributions as opposed to others, such as the [[Wythin|Wythins]]", as stated by the council.

While some Sleethiers worships gods from various religions introduced by other civilisations, most do not. This comes as a consequence of their deep rooted belief in science, stemming from their early research into their own biology as a species. As such, the Sleethiers have one of the lowest ratios of religious belief out of every Kolban-recognised race.
