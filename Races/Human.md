The Human is a bipedal humanoid originating from the planet Estra in the Main system. One of the last [[races]] to begin space-faring (eighth known to do so), the Humans have undeniably had one of the greatest impacts on modern civilisation as it is known today. These impacts can be seen in many forms, including (but not limited to) [[language]] and individual words (such as the term "humanoid"), [[Political and Governmental System|systems of government]], scientific systems (such as the [[Scientific Standard]]) and societal norms. An advanced civilisation, the Human race has shown more technological progression in a shorter amount of time than the other races in the [[Kolban Alliance]] and even stands equal with the [[Dottian|Dottians]] and [[Sleethier|Sleethiers]] in terms of [[military]] strength.


### Physical attributes

Humans are known as the basis for the term "humanoid", standing upright on two legs, with two arms positioned below the neck of the head. Their skin ranges from lighter shades of tan to darker shades of brown, depending on the amount of skin pigment present in skin cells. Humans grow hair in more places than most other races, on the head, in the pubic areas and in small amounts on the rest of the body.

With a body specialised in environmental and situational adaptability, Humans have an average muscle mass but feature a surprisingly high level of flexibility in their bodies. This makes them capable fighters and survivalists despite their slight lack of strength. It also makes them a close genetic partner of the [[Xanfer]], the race in the neighbouring astral territory.


### Behaviour and culture

While relatively weak in physical terms, the Human race makes up for its flaws with ambition, ingenuity and originality. As one of the most diverse races in the galaxy, it is not uncommon for scientific and technological breakthroughs to have a Human involved. However, while Humans are forward-thinking, studies have shown that the majority of them are primarily self-centred and generally think of themselves before others. This does not mean they are unable to take selfless actions as they quite often prove themselves capable of doing so regardless of personality traits.

Alongside this diversity exhibited by the race and civilisation lies a vast range of different cultures, each originating from the seperate continents that originally existed on Estra. Although the civilisation as a whole now primarily speaks English as their worldwide language, many other Human languages are still frequently spoken by many.
