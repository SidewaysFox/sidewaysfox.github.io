The Wythin is a bipedal winged humanoid originating from the planet Aezlothe in the Aeroth system. Although they frequently travel between the two planets in their home star system, they are the only known space-faring civilisation yet to expand their reach further into the galaxy. Their main industry is the production and use of aerolite, a specialised compound metal of very low density (a similar concept to aerogel), used in a range of applications within Aeroth. However, they refuse to trade their aerolite in large amounts to other members of the [[Kolban Alliance]], meaning their own economy must remain almost fully self-sustaining.


### Physical Attributes

The Wythin express a consistent lack of pigment within their thin skin, leading to a smoke grey skin colour. In order to support their ability to fly, the majority of their bones are hollow with a layer of bone marrow present inside, reducing total mass. However, when combined with their easily-torn skin and limited muscle mass, they lack any useful physical strength.

Due to the lack of predators on Aezlothe, the Wythin did not evolve many defensive mechanisms and also bear short lifespans. Their biology suggests that they were primarily herbivores in early millennia, eventually becoming omnivores in later years of their evolutionary stages. In the present day, most Wythins are either omnivorous with a primarily plant-based diet or fully vegetarian.


### Behaviour and culture

Wythins represent their families through coloured markings on the surface of their wings, first marked by tearing small sections of the membrane and then letting the scars grow back over time. Despite being very prideful about their ancestry and past, they rarely share their stories with other [[races]]. Overall, the Wythin are highly secretive and untrusting around foreigners. For this same reason, it can be difficult to discern whether or not a Wythin individual is religious.

There are no local laws preventing Wythin from exiting Aeroth. On occasion, Wythin [[people]] do venture beyond the borders of their home system on travels not politically or economically related. As such, they do sometimes share small shares of knowledge, culture or [[history]] to outsiders in the surrounding systems.
