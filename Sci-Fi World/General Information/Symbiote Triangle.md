The Symbiote Triangle is an unofficial but widely applied term used to refer to the three largest and most influential corporations in the manufacturing market. The manufacturers the term is applied to are usually defined as the "three corporations you need to start a galactic war‚Äù. For the previous 150 years the three companies made part of the Symbiote Triangle are the Fox Corporation, Primus Manufacturing and Sideways Collective Industries. Experts project that this will not change for an extended period of time, or until a new unexpected shift occurs (such as a war on the scale of the [[Cosmian Wars]]).


### Origin and change

It is unknown exactly who coined the term for the Symbiote Triangle, but it is known that it has existed for several centuries. The term first became popular when Bleak Enterprise was starting up, just before the beginning of the Cosmian Wars. The phrase itself is believed to have originally begun as "three [[people]] you need to start a galactic war", with reference to a weapons and equipment manufacturer (currently the Fox Corporation), a starship manufacturer (currently Sideways Collective Industries) and an ammunition manufacturer (currently Primus Manufacturing). However, around the beginning of the 27th century and after the introduction of the more modern organisations, it was shifted to replace the "people" with "corporations".
