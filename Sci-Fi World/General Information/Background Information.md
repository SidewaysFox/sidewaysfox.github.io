### First time space adventurers

The vast majority of [[people]] venture into space relatively early on in their lives. Most coming from working-class families experience exoatmospheric travel for the first time when they first get a job, enrol in a [[military]] or begin attending tertiary education. Citizens from middle-class or, more often than not, wealthier families, tend to see space for the first time in private starships much earlier on.

Some never experience exoatmospheric travel a single time in their lifetimes. This can be for a range of reasons, such as not being able to afford it or simply liking having their feet planted firmly on the ground. Occasionally one may have a crippling fear of space, which can prevent them from ever trying it out.


### Starship maximum reasonable velocity

Starships cannot reach extremely high speeds by simply accelerating for long amounts of time due to constraints and limitations created by fuel usage and thruster efficiency. Another reasoning is general safety - it’s hard to fly something when you’re travelling faster than you can reasonably think.
