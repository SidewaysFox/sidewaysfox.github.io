The Scientific Standard (otherwise known in abbreviated form as SS) is the baseline for scientific units, arranged to have a fully coherent system of units measurement for use in all applications including, but not limited to science, mathematics, technology and trade. The seven base units of the Scientific Standard are:

| Symbol | Name     | Quantity                  |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------- |
| s      | second   | Time                      |
| m      | metre    | Length                    |
| kg     | kilogram | Mass                      |
| A      | ampere   | Electric current          |
| K      | kelvin   | Thermodynamic Temperature |
| mol    | mole     | Amount of substance       |
| cd     | candela  | Luminous intensity        |

Despite its relatively late official universal recognition in the galaxy (which was made during the creation of the [[Kolban Alliance]] and the [[Kolban Pact]]), most of the recognised civilisations had already used similar coherent systems of units measurement in the past. The most similar of them being the [[Human|Humans]], [[Dottian|Dottians]] and [[Sleethier|Sleethiers]].
