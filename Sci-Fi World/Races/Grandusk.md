The Grandusk is a bipedal humanoid originating from the planet Tryas in the Uplioid system. A long-standing ally of the [[Dottian]] [[Races|race]], the Grandusks became the third race (after the [[Sleethier|Sleethiers]]) to begin space-faring after being visited by the neighbouring civilisation. Despite this, they are one of the least scientifically advanced races, mainly trading with companies, organisations and other civilisations gain possession of the latest technology. It is believed that the Grandusks' early meeting with the Dottians actually inhibited their ability to efficiently develop and use their own technology, ultimately making them more dependent on outsourced assistance from organisations and the other members of the [[Kolban Alliance]].


### Physical attributes

Grandusks are best recognised by their small eyes and short, flat noses. They typically have dusty green skin, which can often be up to eight millimetres thick. While adolescent Grandusks lack a substantial muscle mass, adults beyond 20 years old generally develop very strong muscles throughout their body. This allows them to almost match the [[Xanfer]] in natural physical strength.

Most members of the Grandusk race have limited eyesight, with blurry vision beyond 100 metres and even being partially blind at longer distances. However, their biology evolved from the lack of sunlight on Tryas makes up for this with considerable hearing and smelling senses. As a result, the Grandusks tend to specialise in open environments with limited visibility, including at night despite their lack of nocturnal vision.


### Behaviour and culture

The Grandusks are a race evolved with close-combat and physical prowess in focus. Usually, an individual vying for leadership or recognition will prove their worth in battle, either winning alone against a strong wild animal or another Grandusk of already high esteem. Before allying with the Dottians, the civilisation's various groups frequently warred with one another. Upon meeting their astral neighbours, the Grandusks initially waged war with them, but were so quickly crushed by the other's advanced technology and advantages that they reluctantly made peace.

Members of the Grandusk race had previously believed in a multitude religions, none of which remained for more than two centuries after appearing. Upon meeting the other space-faring races however, they soon adopted the longer-lasting religions of those other civilisations.
