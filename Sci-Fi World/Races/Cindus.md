The Cindus is a bipedal humanoid being originating from the planet Crayter in the Firezin system. They have naturally evolved to withstand dry, burning climates under extreme heat and sometimes pressure. One of the latest civilisations to become space-faring (the sixth known to do so), the Cindii are not known for a powerful [[military]] might but rather for their rich economy. This has allowed them to keep pace with the other [[races]] and civilisations around them. A social race and often in trade with other civilisations, the Cindii are officially recognised as a part of the [[Kolban Alliance]].


### Physical attributes

With a very hard and vented outer shell encasing their entire body, Cindii can can protect themselves from falling debris and other similar dangers whilst keeping relatively cool in the midst of very high temperatures. Cindus individuals are able to remove their shell by taking it apart, similarly to clothes. The skin beneath this shell is a faded orange-yellow colour and was likely evolved for camouflage on Crayter. Similarly to [[Human|Humans]], [[Xanfer]] and [[Dottian|Dottians]], the Cindii have two muscular arms, but their hands only consist of four exposed fingers, featuring very thick skin.

While in warm or very hot climates, the Cindii are highly survivable. On average, a Cindus can survive temperatures of up to 150ºC for at least five minutes. However, their bodily functions do mean that they are more prone than usual to colder climates, rapidly losing strength in temperatures dropping below 5ºC. The consistently slow metabolisms of the Cindii allow them to live for up to approximately 200 years, needing only to consume one meal a day and spending around 12 hours of it sleeping.


### Behaviour and culture

The Cindii have historically remained a community-driven race. Compared to other races such as [[Myriad|Myriads]] and Humans, it is easier for them to cooperate with others for extended periods of time. As such the Cindii tend to remain in contact with their families, or tribes, for their entire lives. In the event of a lone Cindus living without a tribe, they are usually either incorporated into an existing one or form a new one with other individuals. These tribes can reach numbers as large as 2,000 over the course of several centuries.

As part of their culture, many Cindii believe in the goddess Privii. Believed to be a greatly intelligent and caring deity to the [[people]], she is said to have united many of the greatest Cindus tribes and brought peace and prosperity to their lives. The third moon orbiting Crayter was named after the goddess and remains an important cultural symbol to this day. The rise of the religion behind Privii prompted a massive societal shift in the Cindus civilisation, pushing it to become more like how it is known today.
