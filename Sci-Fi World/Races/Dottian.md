The Dottian is a bipedal humanoid being originating from the planet Plavv in the Tazzut system. As the first known [[Races|race]] (aside from the [[Autogenis|Autogeni]]) to begin space-faring, they are one of the most technologically advanced civilisations in the galaxy. This allows the very well-funded Dottian [[military]] to only be rivalled by that of the [[Human|Humans]] and the [[Sleethier|Sleethiers]]. Surrounding their home system Tazzut is an expansive astral territory, primarily due to their frequent star system scouting missions.


### Physical attributes

Dottians have a large head, making space for a relatively big brain. Known for their large and highly sensitive eyes, the Dottians can detect a wider range of electromagnetic wavelengths than other races, being able to see infrared and ultraviolet to a limited degree. Coinciding with this, they are also sometimes capable of using scotopic vision in lieu of their normal vision. Dottians do not grow hair.

Similarly to Humans, [[Xanfer]] and Sleethiers, various members of the Dottian race are born with different amounts of skin pigment, meaning that while most of the population have a lighter green skin colour, others instead have a darker or even slightly cyan hue. With a long, thin neck, four fingered hands and four toed feet, Dottians occasionally struggle with balance, usually preferring not to travel long distances on foot. Studies have shown that this normal lack of physical activity has led to a decrease in the mean physical strength amongst the Dottian population over time.


### Behaviour and culture

The average intelligence of a Dottian is considerably greater than that of other races, but only noticeably so in the areas of memory and general problem solving. They are a particularly territorial civilisation, not being as open to visitors and even trade before the signing of the [[Kolban Pact]]. However, despite their closed-in nature, the Dottians never had a religion introduced to their society.

Racism and xenophobia has frequently been a common occurrence throughout members of the Dottian race, although it has been reduced in the past century. It has often led to friction with other civilisations, where such opinions are frowned upon and deemed disrespectful. This behaviour's probable relation to the events leading up to the [[Cosmian Wars]], where they were the leading race of the Plavv Alliance.
