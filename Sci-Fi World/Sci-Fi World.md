The Sci-Fi World is a large world-building passion project created and started in October of 2023. Inspired by the vast inner workings of long-running universes such as Star Wars and Dungeons & Dragons, it focusses on a small portion of a galaxy within a semi-hard science fiction universe, complete with star systems, planets, moons, cities and [[people]]. Technological and societal progression follows a similar timeline to the real world, with some differences to support recorded advancements. This database is set up to mimic a digital encyclopedia, fit with as much detailed information as possible in order to make it as comprehensive as it can be.


### Creation history

The Sci-Fi World was originally started on a Google Slide on the 14th of October, 2023 and remained as a Google Drive based project until the 17th of June, 2024, when work to migrate all created information to an Obsidian vault began. At this point, the Drive consisted of approximately 663 slides in two presentations and tens of thousands of words throughout several documents, all typed by hand. These numbers are expected to and will grow, albeit within the Obsidian database.

It was intended around the end of that first October to turn content and elements of the Sci-Fi World into a Table-Top Role Playing Game, but due to the slow rate of progress and lack of overall interest, the idea was placed on hold. As of present, the Sci-Fi World remains almost exclusively as a world-building project.


### Quick context

The Sci-Fi World is set in a galaxy in which several different intelligence species (and many more primal [[fauna]]) dwell. Some of these species have begun venturing the universe while others are still tied to their own worlds of origin. Those that have found one another have formed a grand coalition named the [[Kolban Alliance]] and now experience a mostly stable peace, but not without a long [[history]] of battle and bloodshed (much of which occurred in a long, drawn out series of wars called the [[Cosmian Wars]]).
