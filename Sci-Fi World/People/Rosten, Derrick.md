Derrick Rosten was the founder of the Rosten Company, now one of the largest retail companies in the galaxy. However, it never became a big business during his life, that accomplishment being carried out by his son [[Rosten, Milo|Milo Rosten]]. Before Rosten could begin profiting from the then-small company, he was drafted into the [[Human]] [[military]] in 2491 during the [[Cosmian Wars]]. He was killed in action in 2501 on the planet of Lemminikist.
