A [[Wythin]] of high stature, Aerin Assimilis was the founder of both Aerolite Mining Corps and Aerotech, two very long-running companies. A well recorded pioneer in the sciences, Assimilis was a consistent advocate for peace amongst the Wythin, and a fair amount of their peaceful policies can be at least partially attributed to him. Since his death the leadership positions in both of his companies have been passed down to the eldest son of the family.
