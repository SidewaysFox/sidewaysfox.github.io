Fraser Regull was a co-founder of Sideways Collective Industries, part of the [[Symbiote Triangle]] and one of the most successful companies in the galaxy. He initially had tried to start a weapons manufacturer in 2585 but in an interview he claimed it “flopped miserably”. Four years later, he decided to instead try constructing starships, another one of his main interests. To help ensure the failure didn’t happen again, he teamed up with one of his best [[Human]] friends, Bill Wilting. Together they pioneered their way to the top of the industry.
