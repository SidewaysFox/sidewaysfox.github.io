Bill Wilting was a co-founder of Sideways Collective Industries (SCI), part of the [[Symbiote Triangle]] and one of the most successful companies in the galaxy. He teamed up with his best friend [[Regull, Fraser|Fraser Regull]] to form the company out of their own small savings. After a few decades the company had matured into a successful organisation, developing and manufacturing some of the most advanced technology in the [[Human]] astral territory. Some years later, Wilting and Regull also made it to the galactic stage. Bill himself was renowned as the figure  who designed some of the most well known and recognisable starship designs, such as the Otera line of starfighters that quickly became the benchmark for SCI and its competitors alike.
