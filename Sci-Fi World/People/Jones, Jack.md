Jack Jones is the leader of the criminal organisation known as the Followers of the Black Pearl and the owner of the “Black Pearl” starship. At the young age of 13, Jones began recruiting cabin mates to live with him in his dorms and assist him in criminal activity. His original motives were allegedly the theft of alcohol and drugs, but upon learning the amount profited from raiding vessels, his motives altered to piracy. Since the he began pirating starships, Jack Jones’ followership has grown, although not through conventional means. It is believed that the [[Linc]]'s company of criminals use coercion and bribery in order to recruit new members.
