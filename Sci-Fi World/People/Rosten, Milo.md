Milo Rosten was the CEO of the Rosten Company, one of the largest retail companies in the galaxy, for more than 60 years. He inherited the small business from his father [[Rosten, Derrick|Derrick Rosten]] at the young age of 19 and managed to transform it into a massively successful one. Rosten wanted no involvement in the [[Cosmian Wars]] due to his fatherâ€™s death in one of its skirmishes, so he accepted no large offers from civilisations directly involved in the conflict until after they concluded.
