Antill Wethal was the founder of GoalKeep, the [[Kolban Alliance]]'s official investigative bureau. Assassinated by a criminal organisation under investigation, many of the [[Human]]'s future plans were put on hold indefinitely. The individual assassin was never identified and the investigation went cold, but GoalKeep still remains in operation today, six centuries on.
