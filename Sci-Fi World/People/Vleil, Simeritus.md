Simeritus Vleil was the founder of Vleil Starworks, a once great starship manufacturer with barely any involvement in the [[Cosmian Wars]]. A popular [[Dottian]] respected for his wisdom, Vleil did not support the ongoing wars as he felt they drew back on what both the Dottians and the [[Linc]] ultimately hoped to accomplish - peace and longevity. His company suffered as a result of this, losing many customers due to his refusal to involve himself with any of the involved parties. Despite his falling during the first decades of Cosmian Wars, Vleil inspired many of the following generations, including several of the founders of the modern starship corporations in operation today, which continue his long-lasting legacy.
