Granule Reduction is a [[Human]] man primarily known for his unique weapons designs that were picked up by SharpTack. Outside of this information, little is known about Reduction. It is suspected that he was born with a genetic disorder that slowed his aging process, due to his unusually long proven lifetime. In one of his few public statements made, he declared that he had decided to commit his life to making marginally viable weapons. This phrase “Marginally Viable Weapons” soon became the catchphrase associated with his designs. It is also possible that Reduction is not one person, but several, owing to his long lifetime and seemingly endless creativity.
