Necto Unthur was the founder of Lance Innovations, a largely successful general equipment manufacturing company. Although Lance Innovations is no longer in operation as a company, Unthurâ€™s many contributions to society have not been forgotten. A memorial dedicated to the [[Sleethier]] was erected on Quatol in 2584, outside where his company headquarters was located.
