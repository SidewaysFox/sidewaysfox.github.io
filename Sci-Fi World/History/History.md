This section covers the full recorded history of the galaxy within the [[Sci-Fi World]]. All significant events from the past eight centuries have been summarised and compiled here. All information uses both the [[Scientific Standard]] of units and runs on the universal [[time system]].


### General history

The first starship to ever leave its planet was launched in the year 0 CE, by the [[Dottian|Dottians]] from their home planet Plavv. It was a simple satellite designed to quickly orbit the planet, in order to test the validity of their assumptions made about space. Their first colonisation of another celestial body happened five decades later, on the eve of the year 56 CE.

The first [[Human]]-made ExoAtmospheric-Apparatus (EAA) was first successfully launched in the year 1894 and was a test satellite manufactured by the now-dissolved Toprian Empire. Humanity first colonised another planet in 2023, after a base was successfully set up on Plix.

Several centuries into the future, after a series of devastating multi-sided wars known as the [[Cosmian Wars]] - fought by many different civilisations over the course of 79 years, a treaty was signed by all involved parties in 2523 CE. They all agreed to have a mutually upheld peace. This treaty was called the [[Kolban Pact]], named after the planet on which it was signed. The terms of the pact outlined a galaxy of peace and prosperity for the foreseeable future.

It is currently the year 2779 CE. Occasional conflicts between two or more parties still break out but generally conclude after six months to eight years, depending on the severity and balancing of their powers. These conflicts are more often than not ended before they take adverse effect on activities beyond their front lines.
