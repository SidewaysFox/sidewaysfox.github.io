Flora refers to the wide range of plants and vegetation known to exist throughout the galaxy. They make up massive sections local ecosystems and are required for the food webs of those ecosystems to thrive. Most plants, such as trees, tend to grow and interact with only other plants and fungi. Some flora instead interact with the local [[fauna]], either using them to further their reproductive processes or even consuming them for sustenance and energy.

Like fauna, flora is heavily affected by the presence of the industrialising intelligent [[races]]. As animals die from pollution and other artificially introduced factors, the plants that rely on them also struggle to survive. Mass harvesting of materials comes directly from the exploitation of these plants as well, leaving behind uninhabitable environments in their place. Recent new guidelines imposed by the [[Kolban Alliance]] are contributing to the effort to reduce these effects of external influence, so that these [[Nature|natural ecosystems]] can continue to function.
