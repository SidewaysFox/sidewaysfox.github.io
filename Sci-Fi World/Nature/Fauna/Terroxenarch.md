Terroxenarchs are humanoid giants that, according to researchers involved in studying their behaviour and anatomy, will “eat anything that moves”. With only a few hundred known to exist, they are considered a rare and endangered species. Several captured specimens are kept in various zoo enclosures on a select few planets. The species itself originates from the planet Zebrox in the Kuloklav system.


### Physical attributes

Terroxenarchs are some of the tallest known [[Nature|wildlife]] species by pure height, with adults averaging at about 20 metres from head to toe. Featuring a majorly humanoid body structure, they are quite frequently related to [[Human|Humans]] and [[Xanfer]], despite sharing very little genetic information with the two [[races]].

Terroxenarch skin is rubbery and approximately one centimetre thick, making it difficult to cut or penetrate. This can make it hard to manage them in an enclosed habitat, such as a zoo. Their immense physical strength furthers this, meaning rooms must be reinforced with stronger materials, ultimately making their artificial habitats costly to build and maintain.


### Behaviour

Given their large mass, Terroxenarchs consume several kilograms of organic matter a day. This can include trees, grass, meat and even their own flesh at times. It has been found that adults do not resort to autocannibalism when in danger of starving, but rather as a regular meal or even as part of a game.

Several recent independent studies (including attempts to communicate through speech) have shown that adult Terroxenarchs are capable of exhibiting somewhat intelligent behaviour, which has prompted both members of the public and involved organisations to more seriously consider the ethical implications of their treatment.
