Fauna refers to the various animals scattered throughout the galaxy. The majority of the animal kingdom has been evolving for millions of years, through processes such as genetic variation, natural selection and mutations. With the introduction of intelligent [[races]], however, the influence on evolution within many species from external factors has become significant.

The primary factor affecting the development of animals is pollution. Major industrialisation of planets and systems as a whole has impacted animals' habitats, diets and thus lives. Deforestation and construction projects interfere with local habitats. Some groups advocate for the overall consideration of these effects in plans for engineering projects, especially when carrying them out on previously untouched environments.
