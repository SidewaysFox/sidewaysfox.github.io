The Autogenis is believed to be an extinct intelligent being originating from an unknown planet possibly within the Keffla Void. Based off of these estimates and supposed remains found in the Vialki-Sin system, the Autogeni were capable of extremely long range [[interstellar travel]]. This would imply that the Autogeni were much more technologically advanced than any known existing civilisation today. It would also confirm that such interstellar travel is indeed possible. Additional evidence in the form of the recent discoveries of five planet-less stars (KD-410, KD-411, KD-413, KD-414 and KD-418) deeper within the Keffla Void further support this possibility. It is unknown what caused the Autogeni to near extinction.

Although officially declared extinct, it is possible that due to their extremely long natural lifespans, some Autogeni may still remain existent albeit undetected in very limited numbers within the void. Researchers are attempting to locate and study any and all available information about the Autogeni, given their possible relation to several historical events.


### Physical attributes

Skeletal structures of Autogeni discovered on various outer rogue planets within the Keffla Void suggest that Autogeni have a very round body, resembling a cell with several long, thin limbs. The exact amount of external limbs appears to vary from individual to individual. Their skin was most likely translucent and is believed to have been of a gelatinous nature, similar to that of the [[Sleethier|Sleethiers]]. This relation has prompted researchers and other experts alike to question possible connections between the Autogeni and the modern civilisations.

A very slow metabolism in an Autogenis gives it an incredibly lengthy life, extending upwards of around 600 years in most known cases. However, it is not uncommon to find Autogeni remains showing less than 100 years of life, assumed to be a result of frequent internal wars within the civilisation. Autogeni also demonstrate a striking lack of sexual reproductive organs, hinting at a previously "unheard of" independent asexual reproduction of an intelligent species. Despite this, the long and inevitably complicated process would have meant only one child could be birthed per individual every two centuries at most.


### Behaviour and culture

It is known that the Autogeni had an established [[language]], currently referred to as Ancient by experts and the public, due to the lack of a known name for it. Ancient is known to be partially spoken by some, primarily select civilians living on the outskirts of the Keffla Void, further evidence of the [[Races|race]]'s prominence in the area. Much of its content has been lost and much of it was never recorded in the first place, making efforts to further understand it considerably more difficult.

An obvious lack of interaction with Autogeni means that little is known about their behaviour and culture. It is known, however, that they were likely a hostile war-mongering race, even with other members of their species. Whether or not the actual behaviour of members of the race influenced that of the species within the present galaxy is yet to be more accurately determined. Regardless, the Autogeni are widely considered to be a fairly integral part of the galaxy's universal [[history]].
