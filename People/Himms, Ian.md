Ian Himms patented the original design of the Himms Mk1 Short Range Wireless Radio Receiver, which went on to become a centrepiece for the short range communications industry. The device was not his only original invention, but it was by far his most popular and overshadowed the majority of his other achievements. One of these achievements was the [[Human]]'s contribution to the design of the third generation series of interstellar communications system.
