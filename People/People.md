A person is an individual member of a race in the galaxy. All people are considered equal under the laws and declarations of the [[Kolban Pact]] and are expected to uphold these laws.

There is a wide range of people within the [[Sci-Fi World]], from all walks of life. This can include people from the most average and unknown civilians simply making their ways through life all the way to the founders of the most prestigious corporations in the galaxy.
