Pas Turf was the founder of Turf Mining, a small mining company involved in the [[Cosmian Wars]]. When the Cosmian Wars began, her company was on contract with the [[Linc]]. This proved dangerous when the [[Dottian|Dottians]] drew near but she ultimately managed to survive the ordeal. Turf Mining remains active to this day, especially in the [[Xanfer]], [[Human]] and Linc astral territories.
