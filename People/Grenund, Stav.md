Stav Grenund was the founder of Grenund Constructive, a leading planetary ground equipment manufacturer. Grenund served for a short time in the [[Cindus]] Army, where he learnt about the ineffectiveness of much of its equipment. This prompted him to develop his own, which eventually earned him a position in the army's design facility, with several other engineering pioneers.
