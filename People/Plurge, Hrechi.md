Hrechi Plurge was the founder of the Plurge Corporation, now known as Plurge Weapon Solutions. He made clever use of the havoc the [[Cosmian Wars]] were making to secretly fuel other smaller wars to benefit off of them without much risk of being discovered. The [[Grandusk]]'s past plots are no longer hidden from the public and they created waves in the news for several months after being revealed, but his biggest creation, PWS, ultimately lives on.
