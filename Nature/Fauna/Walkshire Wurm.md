Walkshire Wurms are fully endemic to their namesake planet of Walkshire. They are the primary source of the unique cave systems under the hills of their home planet. About ten thousand unique individual specimens have been identified within the planet, but there are suspected to be at least one hundred thousand more.


### Physical attributes

Walkshire Wurms are gigantic in size, with adults spanning up to 140 metres in length. They feature large mouths at the front of their body, which they use to ingest material ahead of them, similar to a whale consuming krill. Excretion of waste occurs at the other end, after passing through a long stomach and a simple series of intestines, which span approximately one half of the body.

Like most worms, Walkshire Wurms see through sensory organs scattered across the grey outside of their body that detect vibrations and simple changes in light levels. However, these organs are highly sensitive and can be easily fried by direct contact with starlight.


### Behaviour

Walkshire Wurms have been observed to consciously avoid bright lights (including the light of Jolloy) and tend to stay below the surface for upwards of 28 hours at a time, only surfacing for long periods of time in the event of an earthquake or other possibly dangerous phenomena. From the moment they are born, Wurms act fully independently, spending the majority of their time moving through the crust of Walkshire, digesting the grass and minerals they eat.
