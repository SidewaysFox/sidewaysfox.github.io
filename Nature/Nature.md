Throughout the [[Sci-Fi World]], nature exists and has evolved on many planets, in the form of wildlife - both flora and fauna. In the systems where intelligent [[races]] did not originate nearby, the local ecosystems thrived, unperturbed by the industrial growth occurring elsewhere in the galaxy. Researchers have so far studied billions of different species and sub-species of wildlife, surveying individual planets for decades in the search for unique and scientifically interesting evolutions. Resources - both naturally occurring and artificially produced from natural materials - are also a large part of the galaxy and survival within it.
